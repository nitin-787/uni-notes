# UNI-Share - A Media Sharing App for Students
Welcome to UNI-Share,  the media sharing app that helps students share and access resources and materials with the fellow students at their institute.

With UNI-Share, you can easily share notes, assignments, tutorials, notices, and more with your fellow students. The app supports a wide range of file formats, including PDF, Word documents and audio files, so you can share whatever resources you have on hand.

One of the key feature of UNI-Share is the ability to notify all students at your institute whenever a new media content is uploaded. This ensures that everyone stays up-to-date with the latest resources and materials, and helps to foster a sense of community among students.

In addition to sharing resources with the entire institute, you can also use UNI-Share to have private chats with other students. This allows you to discuss and collaborate on projects and assignments in real-time, and provides a convenient way to stay connected with your peers.

To get started with UNI-Share, simply download the app from the App Store or Google Play, and create an account using your institute's email address. From there, you can start sharing resources and chatting with other students right away.

Overall, UNI-Share is a powerful tool for students looking to share and access resources and materials with their fellow students. Give it a try today and see how it can help you succeed in your studies!
