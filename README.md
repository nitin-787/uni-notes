# About the Project
The overflow of multiple shared documents across various platforms amongst students is an evergreen problem.

UNI-Share, a media sharing app, that aims to help students share the following but not limited to: 

&rarr; assignment <br/>
&rarr; notes <br/>
&rarr; tutorial <br/>
&rarr; notice <br/>

In any format with fellow students, either publically specific to their institute or in a private chat. 

The project is supported by Firebase Cloud Messaging Service at the backend.
